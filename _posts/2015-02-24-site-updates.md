Hi there, this site has been left for quite some time so here's a list of some of the updates that have been made to the site lately...

- Added grunt to auto build locally and add performance updates
- Changed from basic css files, to scss files
- Fixed 404 page and added some extra info
- Added meta data
- Added disqus
- Added microdata on posts
- Added tagline to posts
- Show tagline on homepage rather than entire post
- Fix to pagination

### Next steps

I'm hoping do some more posts soon and make small updates to the site as I learn different aspects of Jekyll, Grunt and other front end tools.

All of this is open source, so check out the [Github repo](https://github.com/tcmorris/tcmorris.github.io) and maybe you could learn something to.
