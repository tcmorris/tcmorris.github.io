Hello.

I am a Bristol based web developer who specialises in Umbraco and ASP.NET. I moved to Bristol in 2013 and haven't looked back since, it is such a vibrant and brilliant city. I work for a company called [Zone](https://www.thisiszone.com/) who are based in Bristol / London and they are doing some [really great stuff](https://www.thisiszone.com/work/) in the world of digital.

Before that I lived in Cheltenham and this is very much where my story with the present day web began. I mention present day since I remember the days of 56k dialup and when a website was mostly just a text feed; hoping that somebody wouldn't ring the home phone and interupt your session. I was of course fascinated with how this technology might grow up further and decided that a degree in Computer Science was the right path for me.

During that time I have been fortunate to work with clients such as Travelex, Swinton Insurance, Barratt Homes, PCUK, British Cycling and Sky.

## Setup

This website was largely built as an experiment outside of the ASP.NET world and somewhere where I can easily add new posts via Markdown.

Some (potentially) fun facts about the setup of this website include:

* Built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), an awesome static site generator
* Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Edited mostly with [Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [MarkdownPad](http://markdownpad.com/) whilst enjoying a cup of tea (not much of a coffee fan)
* Using a theme called [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com), which is built on [Poole](https://github.com/poole) developed by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).
