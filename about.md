  Hey there! This is the beginnings of my personal website. Read on for info.
</p>

My name is Thomas Morris. I develop websites using .NET, MVC and sometimes Umbraco. This is an experiment outside of that world.

## Setup

Some fun facts about the setup of this website include:

* Built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), an awesome static site generator
* Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Edited with [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) on a dark evening whilst enjoying a cup of tea
* Using a theme called [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com), which is built on [Poole](https://github.com/poole) developed by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).
