Hello.

I am a Bristol based web developer who specialises in [Umbraco]({{ site.umbraco.link }}), Episerver and ASP.NET. I work for a company called [BeerBods](https://beerbods.co.uk/), a beer club and subscription service. Previously, I worked for [Zone](https://www.zonedigital.com/uk/), named as one of the best digital agencies in the UK. 

During that time I have been fortunate to work with clients such as Travelex, Greene King, BMW Group, Swinton, RSPB, British Cycling and Sky to name a few.

## Setup

This website was largely built as an experiment outside of the ASP.NET world and somewhere where I can easily add new posts via Markdown.

Some (potentially) fun facts about the setup of this website include:

* Built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), an awesome static site generator
* Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Edited mostly with [Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [MarkdownPad](http://markdownpad.com/) whilst enjoying a cup of tea (not much of a coffee fan)
* Using a theme called [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com), which is built on [Poole](https://github.com/poole) developed by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).
