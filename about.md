I develop websites using .NET, MVC and sometimes Umbraco. This is an experiment outside of that world.

## Setup ##

Some (potentially) fun facts about the setup of this website include:

* Built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), an awesome static site generator
* Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Edited mostly with [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) and [MarkdownPad](http://markdownpad.com/) whilst enjoying a cup of tea (not a coffee fan)
* Using a theme called [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com), which is built on [Poole](https://github.com/poole) developed by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).
